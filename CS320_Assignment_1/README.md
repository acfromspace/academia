- prog1_1.c:

Take at most 65 characters from STDIN. Collect the user input string. Tokenize the user input string. Output each token on a new line with equal signs on both ends of the token.

- prog1_2.c:

Take at most 65 characters from STDIN. Collect the user input string. Tokenize the user input string. Convert tokens to messages. If the input token is an integer, prints out INT, otherwise, STR.

- prog1_3.c:

Take at most 65 characters from STDIN. Collect the user input string. Tokenize the user input string. Convert tokens to messages. If the input tokens is greater than 2, print error, else print appropriate token message.

- prog1_4.c:

Take at most 20 characters from STDIN. Collect the user input string. Tokenize the user input string. Convert tokens to messages. If the input tokens is greater than 2 or the input is more than 20 characters, print error, else print appropriate token message. If the input says strictly "quit" (not case-sensitive) then quit the program.
	
- prog1_5.c:

Take at most 65 characters from STDIN. Collect the user input string. Tokenize the user input string. Convert tokens to messages. If the input tokens is greater than 2 or if a single token is an INT, print error, else print appropriate token message. If the input says strictly "quit" (not case-sensitive) then quit the program.

- prog1_6.c:

Take a single command line. If there is more or less than a single command line, print an error. Command line argument is integer N, else print an error. Program shall perform just as "prog1_5.c".
