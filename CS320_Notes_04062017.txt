Context Free Grammar
    To make sense of code, there's grammar rules (syntax) that is put into place

Source Code -> Tokenization -> Parse -> Code Emission/Interpretation

RULES

1) S -> 0S
2) S -> 1
3) S -> [eps]

Top Down Parsing
    Start with any non terminating symbol, generate all possible sentences, if the target sentence is in the set of all possible it is valid.

1) S -> 1T0
2) T -> 00S
3) S -> [eps]
4) T -> 01
